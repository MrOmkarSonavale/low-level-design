🧩 Low Level Design (LLD) – Practice & Implementations

A curated collection of LLD problems, designs, and implementations written in clean, modular, and extensible code.
This repository showcases my understanding of Object-Oriented Design, Design Patterns, SOLID principles, UML thinking, and building scalable, production-ready components.

🚀 About This Repository

🧠 Identifying core entities & relationships

🏛️ Using appropriate design patterns

📦 Writing extensible, maintainable code

📘 Documenting design decisions

This is meant both as a personal learning log and a portfolio for recruiters to evaluate my design thinking.

Each problem contains:
✔ Problem Statement
✔ UML or text-based design
✔ Class Responsibilities
✔ Code implementation (C++/Java)
✔ Possible extensions

🛠 Topics Covered

Object-Oriented Principles (SOLID, Encapsulation, Abstraction)

Design Patterns (Factory, Strategy, Singleton, Observer, Decorator, etc.)

In-memory data modeling

Concurrency-safe designs

Modular and extensible architectures


🎯 Why This Repository?

This repo demonstrates my ability to:

Break down vague requirements into proper class structures

Use correct design patterns

Write clean and production-ready code

Think like a system architect

Build reusable components that mimic real systems

It’s a reflection of my problem-solving skills and engineering mindset.

🧑‍💻 Tech Stack

C++ / Javascript (Primary languages for implementation)

UML Diagrams (Text or tool-generated)

Modular folder structure with documentation
