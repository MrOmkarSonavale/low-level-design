📺 Observer Pattern in C++ – YouTube Channel Example
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the Observer Design Pattern using a real-world example of a YouTube-like channel and subscribers.

A Channel acts as the Subject

Subscribers act as Observers

Whenever a new video is uploaded, all subscribed users are notified automatically

This pattern helps achieve loose coupling between objects and is widely used in event-driven systems, notification services, and real-time updates.

🧠 Design Pattern Used

Observer Pattern (Behavioral Design Pattern)

Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
